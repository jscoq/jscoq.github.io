# OCaml + WASM

This is a port of the OCaml runtime to the WebAssembly platform.
The core distribution includes `ocamlrun` (compiled as `ocamlrun.wasm`), and stubs for the native libraries `str`, `unix`, and `threads`.
This allows running OCaml bytecode binaries in a WebAssembly container, including in a browser.
They were built using [wasi-sdk](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk), and depend on [Wasmer-JS](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js) and [wasi-kernel](https://github.com/corwin-of-amber/wasi-kernel) for POSIX-like headers and runtime.

The current version is compatible with wasi-sdk 11 and wasi-kernel 0.1.1.

To run a compiled bytecode file, create a wasi-kernel `ExecCore` and pass the filename as an argument:
```js
import { ExecCore } from 'wasi-kernel';

var core = new ExecCore({tty: true}),
    td = new TextDecoder('utf-8');
core.tty.on('data', b => console.log(td.decode(b))); // to see the output
core.wasmFs.fs.writeFileSync('/my_program.bc', bytecode);
core.start('ocamlrun.wasm', ['ocamlrun', '/my_program.bc']);
```

Native libraries (`str`, `unix`, `threads`, and others that you may have compiled to WASM) need to be pre-loaded prior to invoking `start()`.
```js
await core.proc.dyld.preload('dllcamlstr.so', 'dllcamlstr.wasm');
```

(This is using the low-level dynamic loader API; future versions of wasi-kernel may be able to read the dynamic library dependencies from the WASM binary itself.)


## Building from Source

**1**  Configure a minimal OCaml with `clang`.
```
CC=clang ./configure  --disable-native-compiler --disable-ocamldoc --disable-debugger
```

**2**  Build bytecode executables `ocaml` and `ocamlc`, as well as the standard library.
```
make world
```

**3**  Set the path to wasi-sdk on your system (if not set, defaults to `/opt/wasi-sdk`).
```sh
export WASI_SDK=/opt/wasi-sdk   # or any other path
```

**4**  Setup `wasi-kit` (from wasi-kernel) so that it is in your `PATH`.
      Either should work:
 * Install globally — `npm i -g wasi-kernel@0.1.1-rc2`.
 * Install in project — `npm i`, then add `$PWD/node_modules/.bin` to `PATH`.

**5**  Build WASM runtime; notice that this overrides header files generated by `configure`
      with preconfigured versions for WASM build.
```
make wasm
```

The last command also builds stubs for shared libraries `str`, `unix`, and `threads`.
It uses wasi-sdk's version of `clang`, but with `--target wasm32-unknown-emscripten`,
since shared-library support in WASI is still incomplete.
